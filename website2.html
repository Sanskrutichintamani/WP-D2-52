<b><P>CARGO</P></b>
<p>The cargo aircraft is a type of aircraft that can have different sizes, and are designed specifically for the shipment of goods.
The characteristics of cargo aircraft are completely different from those of passenger aircraft, as they no longer integrate the same design model as the latter.
Although, as we will see below, there are aircraft that can combine both passenger and cargo transport. Passenger and cargo aircraft. (PAX)
PAX is the term used in aviation to refer to passengers. Many aircraft combine passenger and cargo transportation. They are aircraft designed to be able to store
 a portion of goods, without losing the functionality and comfort necessary for the transport of people.
Cargo aircraft. (CAO)
The acronym CAO refers to cargo aircraft only. There is a label to mark this type of aircraft (CAO). Therefore, we are talking about aircraft designed only
 for the transport of goods. Its structure and functionality is based on the loading, shipping and unloading of goods. There is no room for passenger transportation.</p>

<b><p>THE MILITARY AIRPLANES:</p></b>
<p>Generally speaking, all military aircraft fall into one of the following categories: fighters,
 which secure control of essential airspaces by driving off or destroying enemy aircraft; bombers, which are larger,
 heavier, and less-maneuverable craft designed to attack surface targets with bombs or missiles.<P>
